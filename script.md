This should be run by some command; it may be like a test framework, or just a series of requests and feel free to ask us on what we had in mind with this if it doesn't make sense! Feel free to implement this script in any language.

- feed the `follows.json` through your `/follow` endpoint, in sequence (or parallel)
- the same for `/listen`
- make a call to user "a" on `/recommendations` and display the results
